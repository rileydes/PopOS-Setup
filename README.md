<h2 align="center">How to use</h2>

I'm assuming you have just installed [Pop!_OS](https://pop.system76.com/) successfully.

1. Clone this repo, you can do a shallow clone if you wish (by adding `--depth=1` to the following
	command).
	```shell
	$ git clone https://github.com/nico-castell/PopOS-Setup.git
	```
2. Given that the main branch is always under development, you might want to checkout the last tag,
	which will be the last known stable version.
	```shell
	$ git checkout $(git describe --tags --abrev=0) # Go to the last tag
	$ git checkout main                             # Go back to main
	```
3. (Optional) Look at the instuctions in thme [gnome_apperance](scripts/gnome_appearance.sh) script,
	and configure the file structure for the script to set up the GNOME appearance with your themes.
	```
	scripts
	└── themes
	    ├── background
	    │   └── image.png
	    ├── cursor
	    │   └── cursor.tar.gz
	    ├── icons
	    │   └── icons.tar.gz
	    └── theme
	        └── theme.tar.gz
	```
4. (Optional) If you plan on building a minecraft server, you should check that the `$download_link` 
	and `$version` variables are up to date, they're always market as `TODO` to be easy to find.
5. Run the [popOS_setup.sh](popOS_setup.sh) script.
	```shell
	$ ./popOS_setup.sh
	```
6. Follow the instructions from the script.
7. Wait, this script will as for further instructions as it goes about doing it's thing.

<h2 align="center">Keep in mind</h2>

- You **must** have an internet connection to run the script.
- If you choose to update the backup image, it will have to download an entire image of
	[Pop!_OS](https://pop.system76.com/). So it can take very long, depending on your internet
	connection.
- If you're using an older nvidia GPU not supported by the latest nvidia driver, it might be better
	to download the [Pop!_OS](https://pop.system76.com/) ISO without their custom driver, and then
	choose the latest driver that supports your GPU from the list the script offers. (I'm talking
	from experience)

<h2 align="center">Known issues</h2>

1. [*duc_noip_install*](duc_noip_install): The installer can't seem to understand symbols when
	typing a password, at least on my tests, the script opens *gedit* for you to copy/paste your
	password and work around the issue.
2. [*mc_server_builder*](mc_server_builder): The link to download the latest version of the server
	must be manually updated for every minecraft release.
